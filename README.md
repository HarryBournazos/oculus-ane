==========

* RECENT CHANGES:

Mac version is out of date currently.
	
The ANE is now DK2 ready (I haven't tested with DK1 anymore)
The Windows version is using SDK 0.4.2 - make sure you have the correct config utility installed.

The most up to date example is made using the Flare3D engine. (the away3d implementation and example are from DK1)
Use the OculusScene3D class as a starting point for your integration.
