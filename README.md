Oculus ANE (Adobe Native Extension)

Mac OSX only for now. Windows support coming soon (especially if someone wants to help out with it)

This ANE will integrate the tracking sensors into AIR applications. It does not yet provide integration with the popular AIR frameworks such as Flare3D and Away3D but that's coming soon!
