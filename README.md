Oculus ANE (Adobe Native Extension)

This will provide Native Extension support for the Oculus Rift for use in products.

The ANE will provide tracking support to AIR applications. I hope to also include viewport adapters to most of the 
popular Flash/AIR based 3d engines, such as Away3D and Flare3D.
