oculus-ane
==========

* RECENT CHANGES:

The ANE is now DK2 ready (I haven't tested with DK1 anymore)
Both Mac and Windows, positional and rotational tracking.
Windows was rebuilt using SDK 0.4.2 - make sure you have the correct config utility installed.

Your engine needs to handle the barrel distortion in order for things to line up correctly in the rift.
The distortion shaders need updating to be compatible with the DK2. It's next on the list.


Issues related to the ANE compiling incorrectly have been addressed for Mac.

*NOTE*

If you are modifying compiling the OSX ANE yourself via Xcode, be sure to change in your Preferences the Derived Data location. It should be in “Relative” mode. This way, the build.sh script will correctly find it. If there’s a simpler way to approach this, let me know. However, if all you want is the ANE you should be fine. Just look in the build directory.

Oculus ANE (Adobe Native Extension)

--- 

To connect the Oculus via the ANE, add it in the Project Properties (remember to also check it off in the ActionScript Build Packaging section!)

Connect to the Oculus in AS3:

	var _oculus:OculusANE = new OculusANE();


For every frame of your render loop, have this code:

	private function enterFrame(event:Event) : void {
		
		var quatVec:Vector.<Number> = _oculus.getCameraQuaternion();
		var quat:Quaternion = new Quaternion(-quatVec[0], -quatVec[1], quatVec[2], quatVec[3]); 
		_camera.transform = quat.toMatrix3D(_core.transform);
		
		var position:Vector.<Vector3D> = _oculus.getOculusPosition();
		// add position to the camera somehow.
		trace( "position : " + position );
		
		_view.render();
	}

When your application is closing make sure to call the dispose method to avoid a crash by using this code:

	_oculus.dispose();
